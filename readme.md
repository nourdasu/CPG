# Random Line Generator
This is a cool poetry line generator written in the goat, the king, the **ONE**, C++.
## Why?
I originally had the idea while in the shower and expanded upon it while at w*rk in a notebook, _pretty cool right?_
## HOW DO I RUN IT?!?!?!?!?!?!
Compile it using 

`g++ -o rlg.cpp *insert name you want here`

*OR* you could use Codeblocks IDE if you don't have gcc installed on your system.
